This is a panel of four experts answering pre-submitted questions from the assembled audience under the guidance of a chairperson. Audience participation will be encouraged.

Fake news on social media, dragnet collection of personal data, being asked to
write code for the benefit of your employers but that's not necessarily helpful
for your users, using big data to analyse the behaviour of users, government
control of the internet, violations of FLOSS licenced code. These subjects and
more like them are ripe for discussion in this panel.

Submit your questions via [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/iNl2p9gtSp1d8dc82).

Think "Question Time" on BBC1 at 10:30pm on a Thursday and you have a pretty good idea of what it will be like.

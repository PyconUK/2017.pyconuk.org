This is a panel of four experts answering pre-submitted questions from the
assembled audience under the guidance of a chairperson. Audience participation
will be encouraged.

Are you a student learning Python? Do you teach using Python? Perhaps you
support teachers or create educational resources? You may even be a parent with
a perspective on how your own children are taught programming! Our panel of
experts would love to hear from you!

Submit your questions via [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/iNl2p9gtSp1d8dc82).

Think "Question Time" on BBC1 at 10:30pm on a Thursday and you have a pretty
good idea of what it will be like.

If you want to run a Django Girls style micro:bit workshop for adults with little to no coding experience then this is the talk for you. Find out what you will need, how to source micro:bits, how to coach etc.

The talk will focus on the practical side, but will touch on ways to cater to underrepresented groups and creating a safe space.

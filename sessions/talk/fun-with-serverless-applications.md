Serverless and the noOps movement are buzzwords that you've probably heard, but could these technologies also solve problems that you actually have?  This session will cover _when_ to use a serverless approach, and answer your questions about how to get started with it.  We'll look at how to write code for these platforms, and how to safely and repeatedly deploy your code to them.  We'll also look at how we can use these technologies to build a skill for the Amazon Echo.  This session is suitable for Python developers of all levels.

Any of you from the 80's will remember the BBC Micro. Well, I got one about half a year ago and have been fascinated by it ever since. The 8-bit 2MHz limitations are part of the joy of it.

Ever since I learnt it had an assembler I've been learning assembly and one day I just thought "Let's write a C compiler for this" (bad idea), but I went with it and that's what this talk is about my journey and findings along the way of writing a C compiler in python.

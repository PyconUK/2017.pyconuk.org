Python has no problem handling large and even infinite streams of data. Just write lazy programs – code which defers data access until the last minute. This talk examines Python’s language and library support for such delaying tactics. There will be live coding, and we’ll draw parallels with similar features in other languages, in particular the Unix shell.

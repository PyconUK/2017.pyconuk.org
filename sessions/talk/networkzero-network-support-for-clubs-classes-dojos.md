NetworkZero is a Python package designed to make two things easy in a group situation: finding the machines in a network; and sending and receiving messages.

It consists of two parts: a UDP beacon which advertises services by name and discovers other service adverts; and a messaging API which offers simple to-and-fro communication as well as simple pub-sub ("news") facilities.

The talk will cover the origins of the module, its use, and the obstacles which might prevent its wider adoption.

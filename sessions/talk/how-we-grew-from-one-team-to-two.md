As a growing startup, the move from one team of engineers to two is intimidating. Splitting the workforce can impact both the team and the software. In this talk, we’ll focus on the team side of the transition, looking at how it impacts engineers and those around them.

We’ll look at how this change comes about and what to look for as it approaches, discussing the options you will have in splitting up your team. Finally, we’ll look at how Osirium handled the change - what we did well, what we got wrong, and what we wish we’d known before we started.

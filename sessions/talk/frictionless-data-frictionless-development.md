A common problem in Data Engineering is how to create a platform capable both of importing and exporting tabular data in numerous formats and of maintaining a change history of the data while users update and query it.

Tools like Trifacta (Google Cloud Dataprep [1]) provide a turnkey solution to part of the pipeline but the open source Frictionless Data [2] tools from OKFN can provide a simpler subset of these features tailored to your requirements.

Just as Pandas [3] is built around the Dataframe, the Frictionless Data approach uses data packages [4] consisting of a JSON table schema and a data URI. These schemata can be easily generated for any dataset and work well for a number of applications such as:

* Validating new data with tools like Goodtables [5] or tableschema-py

* Building a data update interface with tools such as Handontable JS [6]

* Creating declarative data processing pipelines that a front end can
easily interact with via datapackages pipelines [7] and kubernetes [8]

* Pushing data into various databases and repository tools such
as CKAN datastore [9]

* Extending the schema to allow export to linked data formats such as
IIIF

The talk will cover these use cases and compare with the approaches taken by other open-source data science / BI tools such as Datashape [10] with ODO [11] from Continuum and Superset [12] from AirBnB. I will aim to demonstrate that that lightweight web standards like datapackages speed up the development process.

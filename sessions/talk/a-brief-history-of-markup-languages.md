There's a long history to text markup languages, and I don't think most people know much of it.

I hope to touch (briefly) on at least nroff/troff, SGML, HTML, Docbook, TeX and LaTeX, setext, reStructuredText, markdown and AsciiDoc.

I shall probably curse briefly about wiki markups.

The slides, and extended notes, will be available at

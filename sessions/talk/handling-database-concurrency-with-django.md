It's easy to forget that your Django site may end up accessing the database several times at once. This can be perilous!

In this talk, David will explore in detail how concurrency is handled by Django, and by the database. You'll learn key concepts, common pitfalls and gain a solid foundation in how to write code that is concurrency-safe.

This talk has plenty of tips that are relevant to all Python developers that work with databases.

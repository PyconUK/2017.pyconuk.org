      <h1>Panel Discussion - Python in Education</h1>

      <p><a href="/speakers/daniel-pope/">Daniel Pope</a> | Friday 16:30 | Assembly Room</p>

      <div class="textblock">
        
        <p>This is a panel of four experts answering pre-submitted questions from the
assembled audience under the guidance of a chairperson. Audience participation
will be encouraged.</p>

<p>Are you a student learning Python? Do you teach using Python? Perhaps you
support teachers or create educational resources? You may even be a parent with
a perspective on how your own children are taught programming! Our panel of
experts would love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Submit your questions via <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/iNl2p9gtSp1d8dc82">this form</a>.</p>

<p>Think "Question Time" on BBC1 at 10:30pm on a Thursday and you have a pretty
good idea of what it will be like.</p>

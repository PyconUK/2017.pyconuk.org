      <h1>Panel Discussion - Developer Career Progression</h1>

      <p><a href="/speakers/samathy-barratt/">Samathy Barratt</a> | Sunday 12:00 | Assembly Room</p>

      <div class="textblock">
        
        <p>This is a panel of four experts answering pre-submitted questions from the assembled audience under the guidance of a chairperson. Audience participation will be encouraged.</p>

<p>Do you want to break into programming? Are you a junior developer wondering
about the next steps in your career? Perhaps you're at a crossroads in your
career and wonder what to do next? Is there a problematic issue about the
workplace that you think should be discussed?</p>

<p>Submit your questions via <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/iNl2p9gtSp1d8dc82">this form</a>.</p>

<p>Think "Question Time" on BBC1 at 10:30pm on a Thursday and you have a pretty good idea of what it will be like.</p>

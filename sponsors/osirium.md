Osirium lives in the world of Privileged Access and Privileged Task Management.
This means that we separate people from passwords, provide single sign on with
role based credentials and allow users to run privileged tasks without them
needing privileges the tasks needs.  We use Python, lots of Python, it’s an
enterprise class security product that relays many data sessions across a
virtual (in privilege) air gap at near zero latency.  It needs a sassy UI and
analytics that succinctly inform humans who did what where and when.   It’s a
challenge and we love it.

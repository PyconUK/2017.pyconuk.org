title: Code Dojo
---

On Thursday evening we'll be running a Python Code Dojo in the Lower Hall,
based on the long-running [London Python Code Dojo](http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/) series,
now approaching its 10th year.

It's a very welcoming format where a coding challenge is set and everyone takes
part as one of a team. It's definitely _not_ a competition, and it definitely
_is_ a place where beginners or less experienced coders can join in.

The layout of the evening is as follows:

* We eat, drink and socialise
* We usually choose a challenge, but in this case we're going to write bots to play each other at this Python game: https://robotgame.net/
* We break up into teams
* Each team decides how to approach the challenge, both from
  a technical and from a team perspective.
* There's about an hour and a half of coding mayhem
* Each team shows its code and results in front of everyone else:
  how far they got, what they tried, what worked, what didn't.
* We go home happy

Because we can't accommodate the entire conference, you'll be sent a link
to sign up via the PyCon UK booking site. The bar will be open and pizza
will be available to buy.

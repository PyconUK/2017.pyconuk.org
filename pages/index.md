## Venue & Accommodation

* **Venue**: PyCon UK takes place at [Cardiff City Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/find-us).
  There are PDF maps of the [Ground](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/groundfloorplan.pdf)
  and [First](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/firstfloorplan.pdf) floors where the
  conference rooms are situated. There is also an overview of the [City Hall
  layout](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/rooms).
* **Mobility Parking**: If you need to park nearby because of mobility issues,
  please [contact us](/contact/) and we'll do our best to help.
* **Parking in Cardiff**: For other parking, you're advised to pre-book via
  [NCP Cardiff](https://www.ncp.co.uk/parking-solutions/cities/cardiff)
  or make other parking arrangements.
* **Accommodation**: If you're having trouble finding somewhere to stay please see the
  [accommodation page](/accommodation/) as we have made some arrangements
  with local hostels who may still be able to put you up.
* **First Aid**: If you need first aid or other medical assistance during the
  conference, please contact the front desk.

## Communications, Photos &c.

* **Front Desk**: The Front Desk will be staffed for Registration and general information
  throughout the conference. Please ask there if you need any help.
* **Announcements**: During the conference the [PyCon UK Slack](https://pyconuk-2017.slack.com)
  #announcements channel will be used to share announcements and other information.
  _Ticketholders will receive an invitation to join in the week before the conference._
* **PyCon UK Twitter**: You can also follow the [PyCon UK Twitter](https://twitter.com/pyconuk)
  account for conference announcements
* **#pyconuk**: If you're talking about PyCon UK on social media, please use the tag
  #pyconuk for consistency.
* **Photos**: You're welcome to take photos but please be aware that people wearing
  **yellow** lanyards have requested that their photo not be taken. We ask you
  to respect people's wishes.
* **Contact**: For general queries please contact the [organising committee](/contact/)

## Food & Drink

* **Coffee**: Coffee & pastries (including Welsh cakes) will be available before
  the start of the conference and during the breaks. If you want a proper
  breakfast you'd do well to explore Cardiff's cafe culture.
* **Lunch**: The conference ticket includes lunch which will be available between 1pm and 2.30pm.
  Since we're feeding upwards of 700 people you will be offered a sitting between those times
  when you register. It will help organise things if you can stick to that sitting
  but we're not doing retina scans at the start of the dinner queue!
* **Dinner**: There are two official conference Dinners, one for the whole conference,
  the other for Contributors (speakers, volunteers etc.). On other nights, or if
  you have not booked for those dinners, people tend to self-organise into
  groups. Feel free to use the [PyCon UK Slack Channel](https://pyconuk-2017.slack.com)
  for this purpose.

## Atmosphere

We very much want PyCon UK to be a welcoming event where everyone feels
comfortable. Please take the time to read about our approach to
[Diversity, Accessibility and Inclusion](/diversity-accessibility-inclusion/).

We ask all those attending the conference to respect all other attendees
and to honour our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

### The Zen of PyCon UK
It can be intimidating coming to a conference of several hundred people, especially
when they all seem to be so much more at home than you are. We propose the
Zen of PyCon UK which we hope newcomers and old hands alike will benefit from:

* Never be afraid to ask someone's name
* Never be afraid to ask someone's name *again*
* Never be afraid to join a group
* Never be slow to welcome someone who's joined your group
* Never be afraid to leave a group
* Never be afraid to ask for help, directions, advice, where's the toilet?
* Never be afraid to respectfully disagree
* Never be afraid to apologise and/or back down
* Never be afraid to admit you're out of your depth
* Never be afraid to go in out of your depth
* Never be afraid to take a break
* Never be afraid to gracefully but firmly call someone out for negative behaviour, implicit or explicit
* Never be afraid to do your own thing, regardless of what the crowd is doing

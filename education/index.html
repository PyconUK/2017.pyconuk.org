      <p>Since 2011 we have welcomed teachers to PyCon UK's education track to promote
programmer / teacher collaboration and mutual learning. Since 2012 we have put
on a children's day where the proto-programmers of tomorrow explore Python with
the technologists of today.</p>

<p>We're doing it again this year, on Saturday 28th October at Cardiff City Hall.</p>

<p>Teachers: come learn about Python, its vibrant community and its uses in
education; "adopt a developer" and create new educational resources; meet
colleagues from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Micro:bit Foundation and Python
Software Foundation; and observe experts giving lessons to kids on the
children's day.</p>

<p>Kids (and parents): come learn how to build the future at PyCon UK. Experts in
computing education and professional programmers will be on hand to deliver a
series of fun, practical and interesting workshops that'll help you learn the
basics of programming, develop your computing skills and make cool projects.</p>

<h3>What's on</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/training/picademy/">Picademy</a></strong>: the Raspberry Pi Foundation's free face-to-face training programme that supports educators in
their digital making and computing journey. It's a two-day CPD event held at
PyCon UK on Thursday and Friday, and continues as educators are welcomed into a
community of passionate Python practitioners. Picademy is free to attend, but
places are limited. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSjics2BeFPfDToYsnhVxGNhMNHf4YFaDhuiqspwHHQ14QYA/viewform">Apply now</a>!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a></strong>: the ever popular PyCon UK Code
Club, for kids aged under 13, is running on Saturday. Led by Code Club champions
and volunteers, we'll be running activities for young coders' using Python to
create games and more. There will also be a special session on programming
micro:bits and Adafruit's Circuit Playground Express boards - not to be missed!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/">Raspberry Jam</a></strong>: for young people aged
over 13, or anyone looking to do more advanced projects, the Raspberry Pi
Foundation will be running a Raspberry Jam - and parents and guardians can join
in too! We'll be running a variety of digital making activities using Python on
the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h3>Education track schedule</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong>: Picademy day 1</li>
<li><strong>Friday</strong>: Picademy day 2</li>
<li><strong>Saturday</strong>: Code Club and Raspberry Jam</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the education track is part of the wider PyCon UK community
conference, that's full of amazing things to learn and explore. Go take a look
around and check the full conference schedule for details.</p>

<h3>Tickets</h3>

<p>We'd love teachers to take part in the whole conference, so we are offering
<a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/tickets/">heavily discounted tickets for teachers</a>.
However, we understand the pressures that teachers face, and tickets for
teachers for the Education Track on the Saturday cost £18. We are also offering
<a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/financial-assistance/">financial assistance</a> to help
cover the cost of attending the conference.</p>

<p>Children's tickets for Saturday are just £5. Parents and guardians accompanying
children do not require a ticket. A free picnic lunch will be provided for both
kids and parents.</p>

<p>If you have been granted a place on the Picademy course, you will not need a
PyCon UK ticket unless you are also planning to attend on Saturday.</p>

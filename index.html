<h2>Venue &amp; Accommodation</h2>

There are PDF maps of the <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/groundfloorplan.pdf">Ground</a>
and <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/firstfloorplan.pdf">First</a> floors where the
conference rooms are situated. There is also an overview of the <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/rooms">City Hall
layout</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Mobility Parking</strong>: If you need to park nearby because of mobility issues,
please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> and we'll do our best to help.</li>
<li><strong>Parking in Cardiff</strong>: For other parking, you're advised to pre-book via

or make other parking arrangements.</li>
<li><strong>Accommodation</strong>: If you're having trouble finding somewhere to stay please see the

with local hostels who may still be able to put you up.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Front Desk</strong>: The Front Desk will be staffed for Registration and general information
throughout the conference. Please ask there if you need any help.</li>

#announcements channel will be used to share announcements and other information.
<em>Ticketholders will receive an invitation to join in the week before the conference.</em></li>

account for conference announcements</li>

</ul>

<h2>Food &amp; Drink</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Coffee</strong>: Coffee &amp; pastries (including Welsh cakes) will be available before
the start of the conference and during the breaks. If you want a proper
breakfast you'd do well to explore Cardiff's cafe culture.</li>
<li><strong>Lunch</strong>: The conference ticket includes lunch which will be available between 1pm and 2.30pm.
Since we're feeding upwards of 700 people you will be offered a sitting between those times
when you register. It will help organise things if you can stick to that sitting
but we're not doing retina scans at the start of the dinner queue!</li>
<li><strong>Dinner</strong>: There are two official conference Dinners, one for the whole conference,
the other for Contributors (speakers, volunteers etc.). On other nights, or if
you have not booked for those dinners, people tend to self-organise into
groups. Feel free to use the <a href="https://pyconuk-2017.slack.com">PyCon UK Slack Channel</a>
for this purpose.</li>
</ul>

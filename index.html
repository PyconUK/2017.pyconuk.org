<h2>Venue &amp; Accommodation</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Venue</strong>: PyCon UK takes place at <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/find-us">Cardiff City Hall</a>.
There are PDF maps of the <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/groundfloorplan.pdf">Ground</a>
and <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/firstfloorplan.pdf">First</a> floors where the
conference rooms are situated. There is also an overview of the <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/rooms">City Hall
layout</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Mobility Parking</strong>: If you need to park nearby because of mobility issues,
please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> and we'll do our best to help.</li>
<li><strong>Parking in Cardiff</strong>: For other parking, you're advised to pre-book via
<a href="https://www.ncp.co.uk/parking-solutions/cities/cardiff">NCP Cardiff</a>
or make other parking arrangements.</li>
<li><strong>Accommodation</strong>: If you're having trouble finding somewhere to stay please see the
<a href="/accommodation/">accommodation page</a> as we have made some arrangements
with local hostels who may still be able to put you up.</li>
<li><strong>First Aid</strong>: If you need first aid or other medical assistance during the
conference, please contact the front desk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Communications, Photos &amp;c.</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Front Desk</strong>: The Front Desk will be staffed for Registration and general information
throughout the conference. Please ask there if you need any help.</li>
<li><strong>Announcements</strong>: During the conference the <a href="https://pyconuk-2017.slack.com">PyCon UK Slack</a>
#announcements channel will be used to share announcements and other information.
<em>Ticketholders will receive an invitation to join in the week before the conference.</em></li>

account for conference announcements</li>

</ul>

<h2>Food &amp; Drink</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Coffee</strong>: Coffee &amp; pastries (including Welsh cakes) will be available before
the start of the conference and during the breaks. If you want a proper
breakfast you'd do well to explore Cardiff's cafe culture.</li>
<li><strong>Lunch</strong>: The conference ticket includes lunch which will be available between 1pm and 2.30pm.
Since we're feeding upwards of 700 people you will be offered a sitting between those times
when you register. It will help organise things if you can stick to that sitting
but we're not doing retina scans at the start of the dinner queue!</li>
<li><strong>Dinner</strong>: There are two official conference Dinners, one for the whole conference,
the other for Contributors (speakers, volunteers etc.). On other nights, or if
you have not booked for those dinners, people tend to self-organise into
groups. Feel free to use the <a href="https://pyconuk-2017.slack.com">PyCon UK Slack Channel</a>
for this purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Atmosphere</h2>

<p>We very much want PyCon UK to be a welcoming event where everyone feels
comfortable. Please take the time to read about our approach to
<a href="/diversity-accessibility-inclusion/">Diversity, Accessibility and Inclusion</a>.</p>

<p>We ask all those attending the conference to respect all other attendees
and to honour our <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h3>The Zen of PyCon UK</h3>

<p>It can be intimidating coming to a conference of several hundred people, especially
when they all seem to be so much more at home than you are. We propose the
Zen of PyCon UK which we hope newcomers and old hands alike will benefit from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never be afraid to ask someone's name</li>
<li>Never be afraid to ask someone's name <em>again</em></li>
<li>Never be afraid to join a group</li>
<li>Never be slow to welcome someone who's joined your group</li>
<li>Never be afraid to leave a group</li>
<li>Never be afraid to ask for help, directions, advice, where's the toilet?</li>
<li>Never be afraid to respectfully disagree</li>
<li>Never be afraid to apologise and/or back down</li>
<li>Never be afraid to admit you're wrong, that you don't know, or that you're out of your depth</li>
<li>Never be afraid to go in out of your depth</li>
<li>Never act surprised just because someone seems not to know something you think they should</li>
<li>Never be afraid to take a break</li>
<li>Never be afraid to address, politely, negative behaviour or language, whether explicit or implicit</li>
<li>Never be afraid to do your own thing, regardless of what the crowd is doing</li>
</ul>
